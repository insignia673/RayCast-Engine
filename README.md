# Ray Cast Engine C#

This is a First-Person ray cast game using Lode's tutorial rewritten to C# (https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html)

## RoadMap
* This game is currently only in Winforms but it will be changed to monogame framework for DirectX
because resizing the form to a bigger resolution will drastically lower the fps
* Add features like Main menu, Settings, Map creator, ect...

## How to use
* Once in game press 'm' to lock cursor and look around with mouse (move with W A S D keys)
* Scroll up or down to change field of view
* If you want to use your own sprite/textures the textures width and height are set to 256 which can be changed, any bigger and the testures will not be fully drawn
